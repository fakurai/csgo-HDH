# csgo-HDH
High Damage Hell is a set of commands for csgo. watch tutorial on my channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkp8ubULewZfGjPsi6uFHZg



Full Features:
- insta kill for all weapons on both teams
- ~100x damage multiplier
- teamkill enabled with no kick (unsure about competitive tho, but def works for casual)
- after installing, just open console and type in 'exec hdh'
- grenades instakill from much farther range, **if you want to set the range to regular (because its super weird), go into console and enter this without quotations "sv_hegrenade_damage_multiplier 1"**
- throwing a grenade and bouncing off someone (includes fire bombs and flashbangs and all that) will insta kill
- **please note: molotovs also do not insta kill :(**
